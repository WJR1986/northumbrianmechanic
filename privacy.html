                Please
                note that we have no control over how your data is collected, stored, or used by other websites and we

            <h4>3. What is Personal Data?</h4>
            <p>Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”)
                as
                ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in
                particular
                by reference to an identifier’. Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that
                enables you
                to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it
                also
                covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other
                online
                identifiers.</p>
            <hr>

            <h4>4. What Are My Rights?</h4>
            <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:</p>

                    as responding to legal requests or court orders.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h4>7. How and Where Do We Store Your Data?</h4>
            <p>We will only store your personal data within the UK. This means that it will be fully protected under the
                GDPR.</p>

            <h4>8. Do We Share Your Personal Data?</h4>
            <p>We will not share any of your personal data with any third parties for any purposes, subject to one
                important
                exception. In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data,
                which might
                include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court
                order, or
                the instructions of a government authority.</p>
            <hr>

            <h4>9. How Can I Access My Personal Data?</h4>
            <p>If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal
                data and
                for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.
                All
                subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in
                Part 10. To
                make this as easy as possible for you, a Subject Access Request Form is available for you to use. You do
                not
                have to use this form, but it is the easiest way to tell us everything we need to know to respond to
                your
                request as quickly as possible. There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your
                request
                is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be
                charged to
                cover our administrative costs in responding. We will respond to your subject access request within 1
                month and,
                in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response,
                including
                a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is
                more
                complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your
                request. You will
                be kept fully informed of our progress.</p>
            <hr>

            <h4>10. How Do I Contact You?</h4>
            <p>To contact us about anything to do with your personal data and data protection, including to make a
                subject
                access request, please use the following details:</p>

            <hr>

            <h4>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. This may be necessary, for example, if the law
                changes, or
                if we change our business in a way that affects personal data protection. Any changes will be
                immediately
                posted on Our Site and you will be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Privacy Policy on your first
                use of
                Our Site following the alterations. We recommend that you check this page regularly to keep up-to-date.
